							<h2>Origin</h2>
							<p>I began this company back in 2009, after a hike where i saw an amazing scenery that just had to be captured in a picture. The problem was i didn't know how to take a picture so it turned out looking horrible.Thats why i taught myself the art of photographing and started this company to help others who are bad at taking pictures.</p>

							<h2>Meet my Team</h2>
							<p>I have worked alone so far and will likely be doing so for a while.This is because as more people get involved, the less control i have on the quality. I rather have a few high quality images than a thousand decent ones</p>

							<h2>What i have done</h2>
